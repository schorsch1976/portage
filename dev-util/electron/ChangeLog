  Add ebuild for Github's Electron (v0.36.9)

  Electron is an application framework built on top of Chromium and NodeJS.
  It allows creating cross-platform desktop apps using Web tech. [1]

  The main user of Electron is the Atom IDE [2].  Microsoft Visual Studio
  Code is also based on Electron.  It is also useful for the creation of
  desktop wrappers for popular web services, e.g. Google Music [3].

  Unfortunately, current upstream's approach to "building Electron from
  source" involves downloading a pre-built libchromiumcontent.so binary
  from the Internet, which poses obvious security and compatibility risks.

  This ebuild is based heavily on the Chromium ebuild and follows similar
  unbunling policy.

  Additionally, Electron-specific NodeJS headers are installed to
  /usr/include so that native modules built for Electron-based apps can be
  compiled against the correct version of NodeJS embedded in Electron.
